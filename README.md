It includes a Python script ('hello.py') and an additional feature ('new_feature.py').

## FEATURES:
* main: the main branch with the initial hello.py script
* feature-1: introduces user input
* feature-2: Demonstrates resolving merge conflicts. (is now merged with "main", you will see
documentation showcasing the comparison in "pull requests" tab).

## USAGE EXAMPLES:
Example output from running hello.py:

## ISSUES
* Enhancments
- I decided to make a few upgrades using python.
- First issue resolution: I added "if else statememnts" to make sure there would be an error if anyone enters an invalid input.
- Second issue resolution: I decided to spice up the greeting to make it more interesting.
